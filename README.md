ZakOS is an operating system which goes hand-in-hand with the Windows operating system, Zakos has features like creating and deleting files
reading and even a text or code editor like vim built into it, the operating system works on python code written to specifically match the features
of the operating system. Even though this operating system does not have its own processor, cpu and ram it runs on other machines and utilises the 
ram, cpu etc with it.
